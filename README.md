# Iris-Flower-Classification
Built an ML model to classify Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica species using SVM. Explored data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.

# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification
This project is part of my CodSoft Data Science Internship. It involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, using the famous Iris dataset.

# ðŸ“Œ Objective
To develop a classification model that can predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is IRIS.csv, which contains 150 records with the following columns:

SepalLengthCm

SepalWidthCm

PetalLengthCm

PetalWidthCm

Species

# ðŸ§  Model Used
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

Dataset was split into train and test sets (80/20 split)

Data was scaled using StandardScaler

# ðŸ“Š Evaluation
Accuracy score

Confusion matrix heatmap

# ðŸ§ª Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

# ðŸ“ˆ Results
Achieved high accuracy with clear distinction between all three flower classes.
